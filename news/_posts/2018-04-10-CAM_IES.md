Presented a poster titled "Ab Initio Prediction of Metal Phosphide Anode Materials for Lithium and Beyond Lithium Batteries" at the AIP Horizons conference held at Trinity College in Cambridge, UK.  This poster detailed my work on *ab initio* calculations for transition metal phosphides as high capacity anodes for Li<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>-ion batteries done during my MPhil year at Cambridge.

Abstract:

Graphite, the most commonly employed Li-ion
battery anode, is inherently limited in its
performance due to its maximal capacity of
372 mAh/g; thus there exists a space for
understanding higher capacity active materials
to increase the overall battery energy density
and improve performance [1]. Transition metal
phosphides (TMPs) in general are an attractive
class of materials to study within the field of
battery anodes given that phosphorus has a
high theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g, and
the added benefit of transition metals to
improve conduction and structural stability of
these compounds. Here we employ a crystal
structure prediction method to analyze and
study two families of TMPs, copper and iron.
Copper has been widely studied as a battery
anode material, and Iron is an earth-abundant
element which has recently been employed in
Na-ion batteries, making it an attractive choice
to lower the cost of beyond-lithium batteries
