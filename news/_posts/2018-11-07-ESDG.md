Presented my MPhil research in a 20 minute presentation at the Electronic Structure Discussion Group in TCM.  The talk gave an overview of crystal structure prediction, density-functional theory, and its applications to low-cost Na-ion battery materials.  Details of the talk can be found [here](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/114556).
