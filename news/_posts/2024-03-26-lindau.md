I am incredibly honored to have been amongst only 650 scientists worldwide to be selected to attend this year's 73rd Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in June. See the press release [at the FHI website](https://www.fhi.mpg.de/1482634/2024-03-25-Lindau-Harper-Poths) for more information about the Meeting and the yearly conference in Lindau.
