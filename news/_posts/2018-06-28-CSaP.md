Attended the Cambridge Centre for Science and Policy (CSaP) conference sponsored by the [Churchill Scholarship](http://www.winstonchurchillfoundation.org/scholarship.html).  This was a one day event held in London to discuss the role of science, especially machine learning and AI in policy decisions.
