At the 2018 APS March Meeting in Los Angeles, CA, I was invited to give a talk on "Laser printed flexible electronics" as the winner of the 2018 [LeRoy Apker Award](https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/awards/apker.cfm).  The abstract of the talk is given [here](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR18/Session/L04.2) and a description of my award [here](https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Harper&first_nm=Angela&year=2017).
